# Accounting Ledger App
This app is designed to keep track of a user's transactions and records the information. After the user enters a
transaction, it will be stored in a ledger. Through the `Ledger` screen, user has access to several screens that
reveal data. There is an option to view all `Transactions`, only `Payments`, only `Deposits`, or to view `Reports`.
In the `Reports` screen, Users can view monthly or annual reports or search for transactions from a specific vendor.

### Project Summary


:bulb: **Interesting Piece of Code:** The *all-exit* loop.

>> `if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("R")) {
break;
} else {
break; }`
>> *Used this statement for some screens to allow the user to go back with any key instead of 0 or R*
